## Region Types and Service Availability

<hr>

Not all Azure cloud services are available in every Region.  
  

**Recommended region:**

* A region that provides the broadest range of service capabilities and is designed to support Availability Zones now, or in the future. 

**Alternate (other) region:**

* A region that extends Azure’s footprint within a data residency boundary where a recommended region also exists. Not designed to support AZs.

* These Regions are label as Other in the Azure Portal.

  

**General availability** (GA) is when a service is considered ready to be used publicly by everyone


Azure Cloud services are grouped into three categories.
Their category determines when cloud services become available:

1.  Foundational. When GA, immediately or in 12 months in Recommended and Alternate Regions.
2. Mainstream. When GA immediately or in 12 months in Recommended Regions 

3. May become available in Alternate Regions based on customer demand.

4. Specialized. Available in Recommended or Alternate Region based on customer demand.
